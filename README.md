## 🔧 Steps Performed  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Handled **missing values** using appropriate strategies:  
  - Filled categorical columns (`country`, `rating`, etc.) with **mode**.  
  - Cleaned and standardized string values.  
- Extracted **year** and **month** from `date_added`.  
- Normalized multi-valued columns like `country` and `listed_in` by splitting and exploding.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Yearly additions trend**: Number of new titles added by year.  
- **Country analysis**: Top producing countries and their contribution.  
- **Genre analysis**: Most popular genres in Netflix’s catalog.  
- **Type distribution**: Ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows.  

### 3️⃣ Visualizations  
- Bar charts and plots using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** to showcase:  
  - 📈 Growth of content over the years.  
  - 🌍 Countries with the most titles.  
  - 🎭 Top genres.  
  - 🎥 Movie vs. TV Show distribution.
